# Session handoff

**Reset this file at every handoff — see "Handoff hygiene" below before editing it.**

Read this first after `AGENTS.md`. Last reset: **2026-08-03**.

## Handoff hygiene (read before editing this file)

- **This is a baton, not a history log.** It holds only what the *next*
  session needs to pick up work right now — current branch, immediate open
  threads, pointers to the docs with real depth. If you're about to narrate
  *what happened and why*, that belongs in `changelog-agent.md` (history) or
  a dedicated `docs/*.md` (architecture/design/strategy) — leave only a
  pointer here, not the content itself.
- **Clear and rewrite this file at every handoff**, don't accumulate on top
  of the previous version. A stale "still open" note here caused real
  confusion once already: this file kept saying a release blocker was open
  well after it had actually been resolved on the other machine, because
  nobody reset it — they just left the old narrative in place and it quietly
  went stale.
- **`git fetch --all` before trusting anything here or in `AGENTS.md`** —
  diff your branch against its remote counterpart and skim recent log. This
  file is only as current as whoever last updated it remembered to make it.
- **Non-public docs live in `docs/private/`** (gitignored — this repo is
  public). Git will never sync it. If you create or edit anything there,
  copy it to the other machine immediately:
  `scp docs/private/*.md macbook:~/development/flutter/obs_blade/docs/private/`
  (or NAS-ward: `scp docs/private/*.md nas:~/agent/obs-blade/docs/private/`).
  Same goes for any other file that's deliberately outside git — don't let
  state exist on only one machine.

## Workspace facts

| | |
|---|---|
| Remote | `Kounex/obs_blade` (**public**) |
| Branch | `redesign` (off `master`; `master` is current through the public-repo hygiene pass) |
| Users | 500k+ live — persistence + release paths are sensitive |
| Form factors | First-party **phone and tablet** — see `AGENTS.md` + `redesign/design-system.md` § Responsive layouts |

### Machines

| Host | Path | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Headless** (NAS) | `~/agent/obs-blade` | `pub get` / `analyze` / unit tests only. **Never `flutter run`.** |
| **Workstation** (MacBook) | `~/development/flutter/obs_blade` | Same branch — simulator/device runs, integration tests, visual-QA screenshots. The heavy lifter for anything needing a running app. |

Do not commit/push unless the user explicitly asks.

## Right now

- **Redesign finish batch (2026-08-03) landed on NAS `redesign` working tree —
  not committed/pushed yet; user reviews first.** Includes: stats entry→detail
  Hero removed; unified onboarding (GettingStarted → WS setup + app-tour
  slides; version fork deleted); reorder previews reuse real leaf widgets;
  `DashboardElementsOrder` wired into live dashboard with
  compose-when-adjacent (mobile tabs / tablet row); phone+tablet product rule
  documented. Verify: `flutter test test/chat test/websocket test/persistence`
  38/38. MacBook: visual smoke (intro path, reorder → dashboard, Force Tablet
  Mode side-by-side).
- **Still open after this batch:** connect-overlay success morph + confetti
  motion pass on device; Twitch Developer Console app registrations deferred
  (Chat Phase 1 + paid OAuth broker) — see `private/backend-architecture.md`.
- **NAS may still need a git bundle from the workstation** if `redesign` isn't
  on origin yet — don't assume a plain `git fetch` sees the latest redesign
  commits from the other machine.

## Verify quickly

```bash
# Headless (NAS)
cd ~/agent/obs-blade
~/flutter/bin/flutter test test/chat/ test/websocket/ test/persistence/

# Workstation (MacBook, login shell so PATH picks up Flutter)
cd ~/development/flutter/obs_blade
flutter test test/chat/ test/websocket/ test/persistence/
# Simulator: flutter devices && flutter run -d <sim-id>
# Visual-QA: tool/visual_qa/capture_screenshots.sh (keeps --no-uninstall)
# Tablet smoke: Settings → Force Tablet Mode, confirm adjacent pairs side-by-side
```
